  title: "About me"
  content: |
    <p class="lead">
    I’m a data analyst-in-training who likes messy data, clear stories, and dashboards that actually answer questions.
    I’ve worked across <strong>University of Cincinnati</strong>, <strong>Edgewell Personal Care</strong>, <strong>Great American Insurance Group</strong>, and <strong>VNG Corporation</strong>, building analytics products that transform insights and lead decisions from raw data.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    Recently, I automated Google Analytics extraction with <strong>Python + REST APIs</strong>, built a supervised ML model for metadata tagging, and delivered BI dashboards for operational and space optimization.
    I care about <strong>business impact</strong>: reducing manual reporting, improving decision speed, and turning stakeholder “what’s going on?” into something measurable.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    Outside of work, I recharge through creative work (drawing, painting, photography), staying active at the gym, baking, and traveling.
